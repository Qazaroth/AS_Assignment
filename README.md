Before running the project, do the following:
	- Replace "sitekey" in Login.cshtml with your own google recaptcha sitekey. Login.cshtml is located in Pages folder.

	- Replace "secretkey" in Login.cshtml.cs with your own google recaptcha secretkey. Login.cshtml.cs is located within Login.cshtml, which can be found above.

Also, do run Users.sql in your respective database, and change the connection string of "myConn" in "appsettings.json" to that database.

Have fun. :)
